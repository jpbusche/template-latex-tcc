\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
 	Currently the game market has a large number of data, however, these data don't have any interconnection, which makes it difficult to extract knowledge of these data, so there was a need to create a common space, where all this data is connected. Creating an extraction architecture, which requests this data from several sources and inserts it into a common space, could benefit in the future the extraction of business metrics. It will be presented in this work the creation of an extraction architecture, from conception to implementation, and for the analysis of the extraction result will be created dashboards.
